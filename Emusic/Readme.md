## Overview
This is a music ticket store; we sell music tickets.

# Product:
Music tickets for around a dollar. There are several types ranging from $1 to $2 dollars.

# Polices:
Polices allows members to access certain areas of the website; In my instance if you are a Administator you 
are allowed to view, edit, and delete different types of tickets.

# Claims: 
Claims work similar to Polices; only certain users are allowed to access a certain part of the website.
In my attempt; If a user selects ILoveListeningON Headphones; then only the user is allowed to purchase 
an online album. Another claim is if the user only likes country music they are only allowed to listen to Garth Brooks.
